# Warehouse-Inventory-System
PowerShell used to check inventory status in the warehouse. The script itself is an essentially a front-end interface for the warehouse worker to check the status of their inventories. You can create your own back-end database in textfiles. After you download the powershell script, make sure your file location is configured correctly. And, make sure you take a look at the text-file database for your customized adjustments.
